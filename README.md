## Usage

```sh
$ gen gh-repo
```

### API

**Params**

* `app` **{Object}**: [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) instance to add tasks to.

**Example**

```js
// use as a plugin with existing generate instance
// $ gen gh-repo
app.use(require('generate-gh-repo'));

// use as a subgenerator on an existing generate instance
// $ gen repo
app.register('repo', require('generate-gh-repo'));
```

## Getting started

### Install

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `gh-repo` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [Generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

**Install generate-gh-repo**

```sh
$ npm install --global generate-gh-repo
```

### CLI

Run this generator's `default` [task](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md#default) with the following command:

```sh
$ gen gh-repo
```

**What you should see in the terminal**

If completed successfully, you should see both `starting` and `finished` events in the terminal, like the following:

```sh
[00:44:21] starting ...
...
[00:44:22] finished ✔
```

If you do not see one or both of those events, please [let us know about it](../../issues).
